description = "The user hurls a fiery projectile straight ahead, damaging all targets in its path.

The fireball travels at [color=\"yellow\"]5 m/s[/color] for up to [color=\"yellow\"]6 seconds[/color], gradually growing in size and intensityâ€”the longer it remains on the field, the more damage it deals.

Targets caught within the fireball take damage instantly, with damage scaling based on [color=yellow]100%%[/color] of the user's [color=orange]Stamina[/color], then again every [color=\"yellow\"]0.5 seconds[/color] while inside.

This ability consumes [color=yellow]50%%[/color] of the user's [color=orange]Max Stamina[/color] and has a cooldown of %s."
